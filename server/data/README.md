# Shared data directory

This directory will contain files (like images) generated by detectors, so they can be displayed in the web interface...

When running with containers, a shared volume will mounted here so all containers can write files...

These files will be accessible at URL ```/data/<filename>``` (see ```mark-web``` for details)
